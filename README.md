# Welcome

This program is a basic web based Journaling app, using Peewee/Flask/SqlLite.

## Why?

This program was created as part of TeamTreeHouse's Python Web Developemnt techdegree program, specifically, project #5! For more info, check out their [TechDegree Homepage](https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/) . 

## Basic info

The app uses a sqlLite database that is created upon initial load. Then a user can make journal entries via the web form, and later view/edit/delete their entries.
